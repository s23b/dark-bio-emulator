# qemu-common.sh: QEMU sidecar, dependency and ROM collection for macOS.

# Only the host's own architecture is bundled, as the generic
# "qemu-system-guest" sidecar. Bundling both would double the installer size.
#
# The caller defines collect_deps <file>, copying $1's non-system library
# dependencies into libs_dir. That is the only platform-specific part.
#
# Must stay bash 3.2: macOS ships Apple's 3.2, so no associative arrays and no
# namerefs.
