# QEMU comes from apt, dynamically linked against glibc plus a long tail of
# libraries that vary across distros. Every non-base-system dependency is copied
# into launcher/qemu-libs/ and resolved at run time via LD_LIBRARY_PATH rather
# than by patching rpaths: ldd resolves bare sonames, which the dynamic linker
# re-resolves on every run.
#
# glibc and the loader are deliberately not bundled; they must match the host.
# Build on the oldest glibc available, since it is forward-compatible: a binary
# built against an old one keeps working on newer ones, not the reverse.
#
# Do not test the firmware bundling by pointing -L at an empty directory on a
# machine that has QEMU installed: -L only adds to the search path, so QEMU
# falls back to its built-in datadir and the bundle looks complete when it is not.
