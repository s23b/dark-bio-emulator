//! Which disk image the guest boots from, and what an image's path is.
//!
//! Three sources, in descending order of how deliberate they are:
//!
//!   - `--image`, typed at a shell for this one run. Never consults or updates
//!     the settings, so a one-off boot from some other image leaves the
//!     remembered choice alone.
//!   - The image remembered in `settings`, when autostart is enabled and it
//!     is still there. With autostart disabled, the panel offers that image. A
//!     path whose file has since been deleted falls through to asking, which
//!     is also how a device that failed to allocate gets a second try.
//!   - Whatever the user picks in the settings panel, which is then remembered
//!     when they save the form.
//!
//! Crossing all three is whether an image is already booted by another
//! emulator, since two guests writing one qcow2 would corrupt it. An explicit
//! `--image` naming a booted image is an error, because substituting another
//! file silently is worse than saying no, while a remembered one falls through
//! to asking the way a deleted one does.
//!
//! [`decide`] never puts anything on screen. It answers either with an image to
//! boot or with a suggestion and the reason it cannot proceed, and the launcher
//! turns the second into the settings panel's startup form.
//!
//! [`select`] is the same precedence for the command line, which never asks:
//! the named image, then the remembered one, then the launcher's own. Both
//! paths [`settle`] the path first, so the two of them and the emulator they
//! start agree on which file is which.
