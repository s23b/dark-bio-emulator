//! The QEMU command line: which system emulator to run, how the guest is
//! wired up, and the qcow2 disk it boots from.
//!
//! A native-architecture guest is the fast path. It is the only one that gets
//! hardware acceleration (see [`crate::platform::accel_flags`]) and the only
//! one a packaged build ships a QEMU for. A cross-architecture guest always
//! runs under TCG emulation and always needs a QEMU on `PATH`.
//!
//! The guest is minimal on purpose: virtio net and block, no interactive monitor and no
//! graphics. USB uses one host port forwarded through SLIRP. Hardware uses a
//! dedicated virtio-serial device connected to private host IPC.
//!
//! A bundled firmware boots with its serial console attached to a null
//! device, so the guest's output goes nowhere and stdout stays empty. A
//! firmware named with `--kernel` and `--initrd` keeps its console on stdout,
//! which is where a developer booting their own build wants it. The console
//! device itself stays, since the firmware stops serving its bus without one.
//!
//! The guest side of that forward is fixed: the firmware listens on one port
//! and has no way to be told otherwise. The host side is not, which is what
//! lets several emulators run at once, each holding a port of its own out of
//! the range starting at [`FIRST_HOST_PORT`].
//!
//! Everything that runs a QEMU binary, the guest, `qemu-img`, a version
//! query, goes through the same command preparation, so a packaged build's
//! libraries are found by every one of them.
