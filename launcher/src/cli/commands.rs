//! What the command line does with an emulator: boot one, find them, stop one,
//! wipe an image, and say what this build is made of.
//!
//! None of it opens a window of its own. A command finds emulators through
//! the registry, asks one to stop through its control endpoint, and boots a new
//! one by starting this executable again with the image and the port it
//! settled on. That process owns its QEMU and shows the device face.
//!
//! Nothing here speaks to the firmware. Everything about an emulated Ark's
//! identity, pairing and data belongs to `ark`.
