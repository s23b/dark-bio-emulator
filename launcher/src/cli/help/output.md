# What this tool prints, and what it exits with

There are two outputs. The reading output is the default, formatted for people
with blocks and tables, and it keeps those layouts when redirected. --json
prints one complete JSON document on stdout and one JSON Lines event per line
on stderr. Help and completions print text under either.

## The two streams

stdout carries the result of a command and nothing else. A bare run has no
result, so its stdout stays empty, except on a source build, where the guest
console has it.

stderr carries everything a person reads along the way: notes, warnings,
hints, the steps -v narrates, the diagnostics --log enables, and errors. Each
one is a line reading `kind: message`, or `{"event":"...","message":"..."}`
under --json. The kinds are note, warning, hint, step, log and error. A caller
that cannot keep the two streams apart drops the lines that start with
`{"event":`, since under --json every stderr line is one; -q drops everything
but errors and hints, and never removes them.

Color and glyphs appear only on a terminal. NO_COLOR and CLICOLOR=0 turn the
color off, and a stream that is not a terminal never had it. Nothing depends
on them: every state is also a word.

## Values

Absent values print as `-`, empty lists as `none`, and the two truth values as
`yes` and `no`. Sizes carry a binary unit in the reading output and end in
`_bytes` in JSON. Times are ISO 8601 in UTC. The reading output may show fewer
fields than the document; --json always has them all.

## New releases

At most once an hour, ark-emulator reads the redirect at
https://github.com/dark-bio/emulator/releases/latest to learn the newest
release. The request carries nothing about this computer, its emulators or
the running version. It runs in a detached copy that exits within 30 s, so no
command waits for it. The answer is kept in update.json in the emulator's
cache directory, and a nonempty CI turns the lookup off.

While the kept answer names a newer version, start, list, stop, button press,
button release and wipe open with a note naming both versions and how to
upgrade. Foreground headless runs also print the note at startup. Under --json
it is an ordinary note event. The note never changes the result or the exit
code, and -q hides it. doctor looks up afresh and reports the answer as its
update check.

## Log files

Every emulator writes diagnostics as JSON Lines under the data directory,
named after its port, replacing the file from the previous launch there.
Each record carries `level`, `target` and `fields`, with the formatted message
in `fields.message`. `doctor --json` names the directory, and `list --json`
names each emulator's file. `start --log debug` relays those records while it
waits for readiness. The file holds launcher diagnostics and QEMU's stderr;
the firmware console uses a separate stream.

## Errors

A failure prints `error[code]: message` on stderr, followed by a `hint:` line
wherever there is a next step. Under --json the error object rides in the
error event on stderr and, when no result was printed, on stdout inside an
object whose one member is `error`. The codes are stable.

- usage: the arguments do not make sense, or a help topic does not exist.
  Read `ark-emulator help` and try again. Exit 2.
- confirmation-required: wipe was given nothing to confirm with. Pass --yes.
  Exit 1.
- disk-missing: the named image is not there. Check the path, or let start
  create it. Exit 1.
- io: a file could not be read or written. The message names it. Exit 1.
- firmware-missing: this build carries no firmware for that architecture.
  Pass --kernel and --initrd. Exit 1.
- qemu-missing: the QEMU this build would run could not be run. Install
  one, or use a packaged build, which carries its own. Exit 1.
- no-acceleration: the guest would run under software emulation. The hint
  names the platform's fix. Exit 1.
- port-exhausted: every port in the range is taken. Pass --port to name one,
  or stop an emulator. Exit 1.
- stopped-unexpectedly: the launcher or guest failed, including a refused
  registration. A start failure carries the tail of the launcher's log. Exit 1.
- could-not-start: a bare run could not bring the emulator up. The message is
  the report the error window would have shown. Exit 1.
- disk-busy: an emulator holds that image. Stop it first. Exit 3.
- no-emulator: nothing running matches, or nothing is running at all.
  `ark-emulator list` shows what is. Exit 3.
- ambiguous-emulator: several emulators match, or several run and none was
  named. Name one by its locator, or pass --all to stop. Exit 3.
- registry-unreachable: the registry could not be read or refused a command.
  HTTP refusals include the status and server explanation. Update Ark Emulator
  and restart all launchers when the refusal is caused by mixed versions. Exit 3.
- control-unsupported: the emulator does not advertise direct control, its
  socket is missing, or it does not support the requested stop or button route.
  Update Ark Emulator and restart every running emulator, including the
  registry host. Exit 3.
- control-unreachable: the launcher's control endpoint could not be reached
  or understood. Check `ark-emulator list` and retry against the current
  emulator. A failed stop can still be shutting down; inspect its window or
  log. A button input without a reply has an unknown outcome; use button
  release to clear a CLI hold. HTTP refusals include their status and reason.
  Exit 3.
- button-unavailable: hardware is disconnected, has restarted or could not
  accept the input. Wait for boot and retry against the current emulator.
  Inputs never carry into a restarted guest. Exit 3.
- timeout: readiness or shutdown was not confirmed within --timeout. A start
  keeps booting, and an accepted stop can still be shutting down. Check the
  emulator's window or log. For button commands, a reply did not arrive
  within --timeout and the outcome is unknown. Use
  button release to clear a CLI hold. Exit 7.

## Exit codes

0 done, 1 a local file or a confirmation, 2 usage, 3 selection, discovery or
control failed, 7 a wait ran out, 130 Ctrl-C, 143 SIGTERM. Ctrl-C during a
start ends the wait only; the emulator carries on booting.
