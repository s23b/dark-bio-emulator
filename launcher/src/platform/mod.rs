//! Per-OS quirks, kept out of the rest of the launcher. Each entry below is
//! one small `pub(crate)` function whose platform-specific bodies sit next to
//! it, so callers invoke it unconditionally and never carry a `cfg` of their
//! own.
//!
//!   - **Library search path**: `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` on macOS,
//!     `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Linux, `PATH` on Windows, which has no dedicated
//!     variable but does search every `PATH` directory for DLLs.
//!   - **Verbatim paths**: Windows' `\\?\` prefix, which Tauri's resource
//!     resolver adds and QEMU's mingw-w64 build cannot open through.
//!   - **Child consoles**: Windows auto-allocates one for a console-subsystem
//!     child of a GUI process, which is exactly a packaged launcher spawning
//!     QEMU. Suppressing it only stops a *new* console being allocated; a
//!     release build started from an existing terminal still inherits its
//!     stdio handles and still prints there.
//!   - **Attaching a console**: a Windows release build links as a GUI app and
//!     has nowhere to print, so a command run from a terminal borrows the one
//!     that started it.
//!   - **Acceleration**: KVM on Linux, Hypervisor.framework on macOS, WHPX on
//!     Windows, each behind a runtime probe, falling back to TCG emulation.
//!   - **Opening a URL**: `xdg-open`, `open` and `cmd /c start`, none of which
//!     share a name across platforms.
//!   - **Detaching a child**: a process group of its own, so a Ctrl-C meant
//!     for a command's wait does not reach the emulator it started, and on
//!     Windows the flags and handles that keep it off the console.
//!   - **Native console**: a Windows console carries the full palette without
//!     anything in the environment saying so.
