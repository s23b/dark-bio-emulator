//! Telling the user the emulator is not going to work.
//!
//! This is a GUI-first app that people are meant to download and double-click,
//! and in exactly that mode there is no terminal to print to. So a fatal error
//! opens a real window: the failure in plain words, the full chain and the
//! launcher's recent log in selectable text, and a button that puts all of it
//! on the clipboard for the user to send us.
//!
//! Deliberately not an OS message box. GTK, NSAlert and Win32 `MessageBox`
//! disagree about whether their text can even be selected, and Windows' cannot,
//! which defeats the point. A second webview window renders the same everywhere
//! and can carry a copy button.
//!
//! The report always reaches the log and stderr first, so a developer at a
//! terminal, CI, and the command that started this emulator all still see it
//! when no window can be shown at all.
