//! Locating what a packaged build ships alongside the launcher: firmware
//! images, the QEMU sidecar binaries, and QEMU's shared libraries and datadir.
//!
//! A packaged build bundles QEMU and firmware for the build host's own
//! architecture only (see `tauri.release.conf.json`), so end users need
//! neither installed. Everything here therefore resolves to `None` or an
//! error in a plain source build, and callers fall back to
//! `--kernel`/`--initrd` and a QEMU on `PATH`. A cross-architecture guest
//! takes that same fallback even from a packaged build, since the bundled
//! architecture is not the one being asked for.
//!
//! Nothing here resolves against the current directory. A packaged app's
//! working directory is not reliably writable or even meaningful: a Tauri
//! AppImage's own AppRun moves it inside the read-only FUSE mount before the
//! launcher runs.
